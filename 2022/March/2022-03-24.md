Storage meeting.

If everything that you do on a computer is in storage, is _everything_ just
storage?

Is this work about integrating different storage systems, deriving
relationships, getting the APIs to talk to each other.  Do you really need to
distinguish applications from storage?

The bucketing is a tool for driving investigation.  Do not make that an
important element of the work.  Instead, consider trying to build a list of
"features" that are offered by various common APIs.

So, using the work that I've done before and putting it into a shareable
spreadsheet might be a good idea.  With that list I can then start picking APIs
to use for extracting information and adding it to the database.

Margo indicated she would like to have a face to face meeting at some point
soon.
