# Tony Mason: Personal Notes

I try to keep track of my work and thought processes by writing a sort of
journal.  This repository corresponds to the latest collection (maybe I should
move older notes in here as well?) starting in February 2022.

In general, the notes are organized chronologically (year/month/date) and are
technically focused, with some non-technical observations along the way.  I
don't expect this will be useful to anyone else (I'm not even sure it is useful
to me!) but preserving them may be useful.
