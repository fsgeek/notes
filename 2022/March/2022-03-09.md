The past few days have been slogging through the Dropbox API.  It is quite a
complex interface, but it does suggest some interesting possibilities to
consider:

* It allows associating additional meta-data with files.  This could possibly be
  useful, such as recording information that allows linking things back.
* It allows me to see _sharing_ information.  This could be quite useful in
  finding things, since I don't tend to share things with others broadly.  This
  could be a surprisingly useful filter. They specifically have a concept of
  "Explicit Shared Members," which I think could be invaluable.
* They to maintain a content hash, which will be useful.
* I strongly suspect that the APIs across storage interfaces will not be uniform
  or consistent.  As such, my thinking is that creates interesting challenges,
  but also could be a useful way to contribute: identifying interfaces that are
  useful but not broadly available and showing how/why they are useful.

I'm sure I'll find more: this is a rich API, for sure.  For the moment, I'm
focusing on just getting the change API side of it done, but it is clear there's
a lot of potentially useful data we can mine from this.

Most of what I've been doing is deep in the bits, which is why I haven't been
making a lot of notes: it's painful and slow but not particularly insightful.
