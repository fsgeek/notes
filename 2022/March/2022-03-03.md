Group meeting.

Mention the ability to use transducers to do fake identification (e.g., images)
as a potential motivation.

Videos + Images. Do feature comparison across them to detect "deep fakes" in an
automated way. Could be an interesting use of Indaleko.  Use "signatures" (for
example).

In some ways this is an extension of Provenance data (e.g., provenance driven
search).  This becomes "activity driven search" perhaps, or "activity driven
malware detection or something..."  Not sure.
