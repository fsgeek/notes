The "api key" that the Dropbox website generates has a limited lifetime.  For a
more persistent lifetime I need to use the app key/secret to generate tokens
that must be periodically refreshed. It isn't clear to me if the token is bound
to _me_ or to the _account_, but there is at least some documentation on how to
accomplish this [DropboxOAuth2Helper
Class](https://dropbox.github.io/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/html/T_Dropbox_Api_DropboxOAuth2Helper.htm).

Thus, I'll generate a number for a port (is there _ever_ a good choice for a
port?) and use that.  The Dropbox web interface seems to allow multiple referral
addresses, so I can always add a few "just in case" there is a conflict of some
sort.  Doing this also requires an asynchronous handler and a bit of extra
mechanism, since it has to be responsive to the incoming auth requests. At least
it does not require a separate (web based) service (unlike some of the other
stuff I've been reviewing.)
