To continue on where I left off yesterday, I added dumping out a single USN
journal record based upon what I'm extracting:

```json
{
    "RecordLength":144,
    "MajorVersion":3,
    "MinorVersion":0,
    "FileReferenceNumber":
    {
        "LowPart":6192449490729986,
        "HighPart":0,
        "Data":"AjwvAAAAFgAAAAAAAAAAAA=="
    },
    "ParentFileReferenceNumber":
    {
        "LowPart":562949953913893,
        "HighPart":0,
        "Data":"JYQHAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAAA=="
    },
    "Usn":53661925376,
    "TimeStamp":132902517750555505,
    "Reason":256,
    "SourceInfo":0,
    "SecurityId":0,
    "FileAttributes":32,
    "FileName":"47e0ff09840038bc3ca568d903f4b7e2",
    "Extents":[]
}
```

One of the interesting bits of this is the parent file reference and the file
reference. These two values are assigned by the OS: parent would refer to the
containing directory, while file ref number indicates this specific instance of
a file; the idea is that this reference value does not have a short reuse cycle.
Directories normally only have a single path, which means that this is at least
one path to the file (since files can appear in multiple directories.)

Question: what is the "Data" element in the reference number?
